# You can replace ${basehost} with the following:                                              #
#    Any domain or subdomain (i.e. example.com or www.example.com)                             #
#    ${host}         - Normal, full hostname                                                   #
#    ${basehost}     - Mapped base hostname (i.e. www.example.com turns into example.com)      #
#    www.${basehost} - Redirects to some other subdomain of ${basehost}                        #

# Contact: A link or e-mail address for people to contact you about security issues. Remember to include "https://" for URLs, and "mailto:" for e-mails.

# Canonical: The most common URL for accessing your security.txt file. It is important to include this if you are digitally signing the security.txt file,
